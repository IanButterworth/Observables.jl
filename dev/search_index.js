For example, with signals, you can construct a changing UI by creating a Signal of UI objects and rendering them as the signal changes.

You can arbitrarily attach outputs to inputs allowing structuring code in a signals-and-slots kind of pattern.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Another difference is Observables are synchronous, Signals are asynchronous.

If instead you want to compute a new Observable from an old one, use map(f, ::Observable).\n\nIf weak = true is set, the new connection will be removed as soon as the returned ObserverFunction is not referenced anywhere and is garbage collected. This is useful if some parent object makes connections to outside observables and stores the resulting ObserverFunction instances. Then, once that parent object is garbage collected, the weak observable connections are removed automatically.\n\nExample\n\njulia> obs = Observable(0)\nObservable{Int64} with 0 listeners.
